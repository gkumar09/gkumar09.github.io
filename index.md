<p>Hi, Welcome to my webpage!<br/>
<br/> 
I am a Bioinformatician working as a Computational Biologist in the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Research Center- a Thomas Jeffersons affiliated cancer research center in Philadelphia, PA in USA</p>

<p>Briefly, my research interests are two-fold: first, to understand the mechanism of cancer progression ranges from developing computational algorithms that enables scientists or clinicians to efficiently analyze high-throughput sequencing data to understanding the mechanism of cancer progression</p>
