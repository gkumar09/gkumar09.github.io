<p>Hi, Welcome to my webpage!<br/>
<br/> 
I am a computational biologist working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Cancer Biology at Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA, in the USA.</p>

<p>The overarching goal of my research is to leverage high-throughput sequencing technologies and computational approaches to improve outcomes for cancer patients. My primary research interests are twofold, firstly, to identify biomarkers for immunotherapy response in cancer using various bioinformatics and machine learning methods. Secondly, to develop new methods and computational tools that not only streamline the interrogation of large-scale quantitative next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects but also facilitate the clinical care of cancer patients.</p>
